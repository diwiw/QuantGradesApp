# v1.0.0 — REST API • Release Bundles • Stable Config • Documentation Overhaul

**Release date:** 2026-01-30

This release marks the first *stable 1.x milestone*:
✔ production-ready REST API,
✔ installable Linux & Windows bundles,
✔ finalized configuration model,
✔ documented architecture and workflows.

CI test coverage is intentionally *reduced but controlled* — full CI hardening is scheduled for **v1.0.5**.

## 🚀 Added

### **REST API v1**
- Lightweight REST API (cpp-httplib / crow)
- Health & version endpoints
- CSV ingestion endpoint
- JSON reporting endpoint
- Integrated config & logging
- Optional build via `BUILD_API=ON/OFF`

### **Release Packaging**
- Linux standalone bundle (`.tar.gz`)
- Windows portable bundle (`.zip`)
- Bundled:
  - executables (`quantgrades_api`)
  - runtime configs (prod / dev / test)
  - example CSV datasets
  - README & documentation
- No compilation required to run

### **Configuration Model**
- Explicit JSON-based configuration
- Profiles: `conf.json`, `conf.dev.json`, `conf.test.json`
- Environment overrides (`QGA_PROFILE`, `QGA_*`)
- Runtime validation with warnings (no silent fallbacks)

### **Documentation**
- Fully rewritten README for v1.0.0
- Quickstart (bundle-based)
- REST API usage documented
- Architecture & class diagrams finalized

---

## 🔧 Changed

- Repository structure normalized (`src/`, `include/`, `config/`, `tools/`)
- CLI & API unified around the same config model
- Deterministic runtime defaults
- Improved logging defaults and validation
- Test execution aligned with explicit config usage

---

## 🧪 Testing & CI

- CI builds stable on Linux and Windows
- Test surface intentionally reduced
- Some unit and E2E tests postponed due to:
  - config schema refactor
  - missing HTTP mock server
  - Windows multi-config CTest discovery
- E2E test target intentionally disabled in v1.0.0 (tests/e2e excluded from build); re-enabled in v1.0.5.

These are *infrastructure limitations*, not runtime regressions.

---

## 🧹 Quality / Cleanup

- Removed deprecated paths and legacy code
- Updated `.gitignore`
- Cleaned CMake layout
- Improved documentation consistency

---

## 🔜 Planned for v1.0.5 — *Advanced Test Infrastructure*

- Unified test layout (unit / integration / system / perf)
- HTTP mock server for ingest tests
- MockLogger for deterministic outputs
- Coverage reporting in CI
- Windows/Linux unified test paths
- Fully rewritten CTest configuration
- Target: ≥ 70% core test coverage
